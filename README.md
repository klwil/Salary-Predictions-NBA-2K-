# Salary-Predictions-NBA-2K20-

I love the 2k Series and wanted to test different regression methods using a pipeline to predict the salary of players based on some of the features from in game data for NBA 2k20. 

The ipynb notebook is split into different sections:
'Loading the Data'
'Cleaning the Data'
'Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)'
'Model Implementation'

Libraries used was numpy, pandas, sklearn, seabron, matplotlib, and scipy

I plan on using libraries in tensorflow to predict performances as well.

The dataset used for this project is available on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/nba2k20-player-dataset
