# Salary-Predictions-NBA-2K20-

I love the 2k Series and wanted to test different regression methods to predict the salary of players based on some of the features from in game data for NBA 2k20. 

The ipynb notebook is split into different sections:
'Loading the Data'
'Cleaning the Data'
'Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)'
'Model Implementation'

The dataset used for this project is available on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/nba2k20-player-dataset
